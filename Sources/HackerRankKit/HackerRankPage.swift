///
/// HackerRank paginates by `offset`/`limit` and returns an absolute `next` URL for the
/// following page. `total` is deliberately reported as `nil` so the transport uses its
/// sequential `next`-walk rather than its page-number fast path, which assumes
/// `?page=N` URLs HackerRank does not honour. Pagination metadata other than `data`
/// and `next` is ignored.
///
/// `data` is decoded **leniently**: any single record that fails to decode is dropped
/// rather than failing the whole page, so one malformed item on a live account never breaks
/// the entire list. The models are already resilient (every non-identifying field optional);
/// this is the page-level backstop.
