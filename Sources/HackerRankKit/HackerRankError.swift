/// carries the facts (the HTTP status and body, the underlying `URLError`, the decode
/// detail) without deciding how to phrase them for a user. Consumers that want
/// localized, user-facing sentences conform `HackerRankError` to `LocalizedError`
/// themselves, mapping the cases to their own copy and catalog.

/// The ``HackerRankClient`` retries idempotent GET requests on the transient cases
/// before surfacing one; see ``HackerRankClient``.
